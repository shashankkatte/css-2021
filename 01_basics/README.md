# The basics

## Ways of addding css styles

1. Inline styling using style attribute to HTML element. This approach is like hard coding and is not recommended. It can get complicated to soon too fast.

2. Using css selectors is better way. by using the style tag in the head section of html

3. Using an external style sheet. this is the best way and is most reusable. This approach is also more efficient as one css file is cashed / downloaded vs inline styling where everytime page needs to load its styles and page size is increased.
