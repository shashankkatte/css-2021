# Info and Notes

## Css class vs ID selectors

* Class cselectors are reusable and it is first choice in most scenarios

* Id is native to HTMl not css so when ever possible use class selectors.

## !important annotation

It overrides specificity and all other selectors. You shouldnt really use it unless there is no other way out

## Not() pseudo class

It can be handy in some situations, like overwriting. Its better to not use it and use the postive cases. Not is just harder and confusing to check.
